# No more "Mother, may I?"
Ever get annoyed by those pop-ups in the game that make you feel like it's an over-protective parent scolding you each time you try something? This add-on is for you! It removes four annoying confirmation dialogs that pop up to warn you you're about to do something, even though it's mostly inconsequential.

- Confirming you want to loot a bind-on-pickup item (called `loot` on the command line). 
- Confirming you want to roll on a bind-on-pickup item (called `roll` on the command line).
- Confirming you want to deposit a modified item (one that's enchanted, gemmed, or still tradable) into void storage (called `void` on the command line).
- Confirming you want to sell an item looted in a group while it is still tradable with others who were in the group (called `vendor` on the command line).
- Confirming you want to mail an item you purchased from a vendor while it can still be returned for a refund (called `mail` on the command line).

In all cases, the add-on removes the dialog and makes the game think you clicked "Okay" to allow the action. That's it!

In addition, it simplifies the following dialog:

- Changing the dialog that requires you to type "delete" when deleting a good item into a simple yes/no box (called `delete` on the command line).

You can change your settings using the standard addon options screen, or using the command line options in the game. Your settings are saved separately for each character, so you can set it up as you like.

## Configuration
The easiest way to configure the addon is through the standard Blizzard addon interface. If you want to use the command line instead, type `/apr` to see your options.

## Version Notes
Version 7 adds compatibility with WoW Classic.

Version 6 adds the option to hide the popup when mailing a refundable item bought from a vendor.

So far, I've tested this add-on in a variety of groups, and it seems to work well for all loot scenarios I've encountered. If you encounter any errors, PLEASE open a ticket [here](https://github.com/KyrosKrane/AnnoyingPopupRemover/issues) including the FULL error message. I also need to know whether you were solo, in a group, or in a raid; and what the group/raid loot settings were (e.g., master loot, NBG, etc., and what the loot threshold was).

## Known errors
None!

I don't have a toon high enough to test thoroughly on WoW Classic, so if you find any errors, please report them in the comments here, or (preferably) [open an issue](https://github.com/KyrosKrane/AnnoyingPopupRemover/issues) on Github.

## Future update plans
None! Let me know what you'd like to see in the comments section. Or for live support, [visit my Discord server](https://discord.gg/YRBDrxQ)!
